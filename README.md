Just del your .vimrc and clone this .vimrc.
Hotkeys you get:
<F2> save file (equal :wq)
<F5> files bar to work with (nerd tree)
<F9> open wildmenu 4 chosing what to do with file (after <F2> hit): to compile or to run .cpp or .py or run valgrind.
<F10> exit file.

Of cource one need to preinstall valgrind, clang-tools. vim-nox and so on you know.
Also one should cd YouCompleteMe dir and install.py --clangd-completer.
And clone Paper color (color scheme) to .vim/color dir (line 29 in .vimrc).
As a result you get imho the lightest and the fastest IDE.
